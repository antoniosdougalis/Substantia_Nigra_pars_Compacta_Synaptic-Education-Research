Lower Affinity of Isradipine for L-Type Ca2+ Channels during Substantia Nigra Dopamine Neuron-Like Activity: Implications for Neuroprotection in Parkinson's Disease. J Neurosci. 2017 Jul 12;37(28):6761-6777. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2946-16.2017. Epub 2017 Jun 7. PMID: 28592699; PMCID: PMC6596555.


Full control of ionic properties and synaptic properties allow full exploration of neuronal firing and its dependence on fuzzy noise, synaptic bombardment and calcium accumulation.
To run have NEURON environment installed in your pc and doubleclick the Ortner_Simulation - SimTest.hoc file: 

Depending on your distribution, you may need to recompile the .mod files as c and o files by building up the library file via mknrndll functionality
Run the mknrndll.exe (from the NEURON installation folder) and specify the model folder as the target folder in order to compile the .mod files contained therein into an nrnmech.dll library file.
